Need add new c.c. for statistics like CacheGetElm,
CacheCleanElm - add here field size of cache for ts.
For ucpMonitor :
NEW C.C.
AvailableConnCnt
BorrowedConnCnt
add this c.c. as fields in WsStat for WebUI.

0) NEXT BIG STEP, make WebUI with graphics from WsStat

0) Search path to store debug.html and wsui.html as resources, not like external files.

0) refactoring code with .when

0) dict can be related with trunc(sysdate) - add it in request. And cache life time is related too.

0) check throw new OutOfMemoryError()

0) Create new db schema for all possible cases of calls.

1) Add new structure - UcpStat
(
ts,ac,bc,...different timings
)
store it as Ref in UCP and populate with ucp for WebUI monitor.

2) Cache entity synchronize, need store full request information.

3) WebUI possibilities to change ucp properties.

4) Some queries can be related from sysdate. We need add key
nocache: 1  - Option - by default everything is cached and this key is absent.

5) Use heap informatin
// Get current size of heap in bytes
long heapSize = Runtime.getRuntime().totalMemory();

// Get maximum size of heap in bytes. The heap cannot grow beyond this size.
// Any attempt will result in an OutOfMemoryException.
long heapMaxSize = Runtime.getRuntime().maxMemory();

// Get amount of free memory within the heap in bytes. This size will increase
// after garbage collection and decrease as new objects are created.
long heapFreeSize = Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory();
